- In the dialog, click on **Use prebuilt model** and choose **Use in a flow** option from the dropdown. This means we will build a re-usable Power Automate Flow to create a re-usable Flow to Extract all the text in photos and PDF documents (OCR). 

- Select the **Track expenses by scanning receipts to your OneDrive for Business** template that is already pre-created.

- In OneDrive click on the **Add new** button and choose **Files upload**

- Upload the following file **Receipts.xlsx** from the Lab Downloads file in the **AIBuilderLabFiles\ReceiptsProcessing_Contoso** folder.

- Return to the **Flow** tab in the browser

- There are two steps that need additional configuration. Select the first step called **When a file is created**. When selected the properties panel will open. Click on the **folder** icon and choose **Root** to select the top level folder in **OneDrive**.

- Switch back to the OneDrive tab and upload one of the sample receipts from the C:\LabFiles\ReceiptsProcessing_Contoso folder.

    > The values were parsed from the uploaded reciept and stored in the spreadsheet.

    

## Summary

In this exercise, you created a flow that leveraged a pre-created AI Builder model to parse data out of uploaded reciepts and saved the results in a spreadsheet all without writing any code.
